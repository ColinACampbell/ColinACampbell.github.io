# Overview
Repository contains the code for my porfolio website, this is currently a side project as I am having exams from May to June. 
This is just to keep me productive on IT while studying for CAPE exams. This project is not yet fully completed.

# Structure
I've design and built the website bearing simplicity in mind. Here are the files and their purpose :

 * ## index.html - location : `root`
   Contains the backbone code for the project, and every aspect of the website is located in this one file ;
   didn't see the need to use href links to other pages for a small project.
   
 * ## skeleton.css - location : `styling/skeleton.css`
    Real simple css framework for a small project.  The column, row and button classes were utilized and some other components customized 
    in the file.
    
 * ## main.css - location : `styling/main.css`
    Most of the styling of the website is done here
    
 * ## jquery-3.3.1.js - location : `script/jquery-3.3.1.js`
    Library used to write short hand javascript code
    
 * ## view.js - location : `script/view.js`
    Contains the code that handle events for the DOM and manipulates the DOM whenever the user interacts with certain aspects of the website.
    Note, it has nothing to do with vue.js.
    
 * ## graphics : folder - location `graphics`
    Consists of pictures that are used in `index.html`
    
 * ### There are files withing the project that aren't acknowledged above, those files are not and/or no longer being used in the project
